Analysis Steps

1. Importing SPI Data
Objective: Load the SPI data into MATLAB for analysis.
Method: Use readtable to import data from SPI_data1.xlsx.
2. Identifying Numeric and Categorical Columns
Objective: Differentiate between numeric and categorical data for appropriate processing.
Method: Use varfun, strcmp, and related functions to identify and separate numeric and categorical columns.
3. Converting Numeric Table to Array
Objective: Convert the numeric data table into an array format suitable for mathematical operations.
Method: Use table2array to perform the conversion.
4. Standardizing the Numeric Data
Objective: Normalize the numeric data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
Method: Compute the mean (Xmean) and standard deviation (Xstd) of the data, and standardize the data using these values.
5. Computing Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Objective: Reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variability.
Method: Use the pca function to compute principal components.
6. Defining Initial K Value
Objective: Establish an initial number of clusters for clustering methods.
Method: Evaluate explained variances for different numbers of clusters (K) using PCA results.
7. Computing K-means Clustering
Objective: Group the data into clusters based on the identified number of principal components and initial K value.
Method: Use the kmeans function to perform clustering.
8. Determining Optimal K Value
Objective: Identify the optimal number of clusters using both the elbow method and pseudo F-statistics.
Methods:
Elbow Method: Use elbow_method.m to find the elbow point.
Pseudo F-statistics: Use psF.m to compute the pseudo F-statistics, selecting the K with the highest pF.
9. Computing Reduced K-means
Objective: Perform K-means clustering on reduced data based on initial and optimal K values.
Method: Use REDKM.m to compute reduced K-means.
10. Computing Factorial K-means
Objective: Execute factorial K-means clustering based on initial and optimal K values.
Method: Use FKM.m for factorial K-means clustering.
11. Computing Clustering and Disjoint PCA
Objective: Apply clustering and disjoint PCA based on initial and optimal K values.
Method: Use CDPCA.m for the analysis.
12. Computing Double K-means
Objective: Execute double K-means clustering based on initial and optimal K values.
Method: Use DKM.m for double K-means clustering.
13. Analyzing and Comparing Results
Objective: Compare the explained variances of different methods for different K values.
Method: Use confusion matrices to evaluate the clustering performance across methods and K values.
14. Save and Display Analysis Results
Description: Save the analysis results to a .mat file and display a summary of the key findings.
Method: Use the save function to save results and disp to display the summary.
