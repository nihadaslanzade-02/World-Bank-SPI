## Analysis Steps

### 1. Importing SPI Data
Import and load the SPI data into MATLAB for analysis.
### 2. Identifying Numeric and Categorical Columns
_Objective:_ Differentiate between numeric and categorical data for appropriate processing.
_Method:_ Use varfun, strcmp, and related functions to identify and separate numeric and categorical columns.
### 3. Converting Numeric Table to Array
_Objective:_ Convert the numeric data table into an array format suitable for mathematical operations.
_Method:_ Use table2array to perform the conversion.
### 4. Standardizing the Numeric Data
_Objective:_ Normalize the numeric data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
_Method:_ Compute the mean (Xmean) and standard deviation (Xstd) of the data, and standardize the data using these values.
### 5. Computing Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
_Objective:_ Reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variability.
_Method:_ Use the pca function to compute principal components.
### 6. Defining Initial K Value
_Objective:_ Establish an initial number of clusters for clustering methods.
_Method:_ Evaluate explained variances for different numbers of clusters (K) using PCA results.
### 7. Computing K-means Clustering
_Objective:_ Group the data into clusters based on the identified number of principal components and initial K value.
_Method:_ Use the kmeans function to perform clustering.
### 8. Determining Optimal K Value
_Objective:_ Identify the optimal number of clusters using both the elbow method and pseudo F-statistics.
_Methods:_
___Elbow Method:___ Use elbow_method.m to find the elbow point.
___Pseudo F-statistics:___ Use psF.m to compute the pseudo F-statistics, selecting the K with the highest pF.
### 9. Computing Reduced K-means
_Objective:_ Perform K-means clustering on reduced data based on initial and optimal K values.
_Method:_ Use REDKM.m to compute reduced K-means.
### 10. Computing Factorial K-means
_Objective:_ Execute factorial K-means clustering based on initial and optimal K values.
_Method:_ Use FKM.m for factorial K-means clustering.
### 11. Computing Clustering and Disjoint PCA
_Objective:_ Apply clustering and disjoint PCA based on initial and optimal K values.
_Method:_ Use CDPCA.m for the analysis.
### 12. Computing Double K-means
_Objective:_ Execute double K-means clustering based on initial and optimal K values.
_Method:_ Use DKM.m for double K-means clustering.
### 13. Analyzing and Comparing Results
_Objective:_ Compare the explained variances of different methods for different K values.
_Method:_ Use confusion matrices to evaluate the clustering performance across methods and K values.
### 14. Save and Display Analysis Results
_Description:_ Save the analysis results to a .mat file and display a summary of the key findings.
_Method:_ Use the save function to save results and disp to display the summary.
